So far I have written and added the following sketches to the PublicGallery folder:

-   **macSpeechSynthesizer.ino** sketch to make your Mac speak anything your Arduino tells it to
-   **openWeatherMap.ino** sketch to retrieve the city name, latitude, longitude, current conditions, temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction for any zip code.
-   **datetime.ino** sketch to retrieve the current date and time from Windows, Mac, and Linux hosts!
